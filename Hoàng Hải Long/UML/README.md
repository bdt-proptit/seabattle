# Sea Battle

Sea Battle is a game for two players. The game is played on two grids, one for each player. The grids are typically square – usually 10×10. In first turn, player place their battleship then the opponent does. Then in each turn, player can choose a square on their opponent grid then attack it. In a turn, players do not see where their opponent's ships are placed.
